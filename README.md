# Task Overview:
this task is about setting up Python and learning basic NumPy and Pandas operations, and creating simple data visualizations using Matplotlib.
## Week 1
## Task Requirements
- Understanding Data Science & Python Setup

1. Write a short 300-word summary on:
  - What is Data Science?
  - Difference between Data Science, AI, and Machine Learning.
  - Real-world Applications of Data Science
    
2. Save this in a Markdown file (DataScience_Intro.md)

3. Install Python (>=3.8)

4. Install required libraries: pip install numpy pandas matplotlib

5. Create a requirements.txt file listing installed libraries: pip freeze > requirements.txt

## 2Ô∏è. NumPy & Pandas Basics 
**NumPy Task:**
- Write a Python script (numpy_basics.py) that: o Creates a NumPy array with random numbers. o Prints basic operations (sum, mean, max, min).

**Pandas Task:**
- Write a Python script (pandas_basics.py) that: o Reads a small sample CSV file (Create one manually if needed). o Prints the first five rows of the dataset. o Displays basic statistics of the dataset.
## 3. Basic Data Visualization
- Write a Python script (data_visualization.py) that: o Generates random data and plots a line graph using Matplotlib. o Saves the plot as an image (plot.png).
